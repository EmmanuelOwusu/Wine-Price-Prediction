# Wine-Price-Prediction
This is an class kaggle  competition on predicting the price of wine.

# Summary

* Predicting the price of wine based on a collection of reviews and other
product features.

* We use the Random Forest Regressor and the XGBoost Algorithm to
 predict the prices of wine.
 
 * Feature Engineering : We perform the following 
 
   * Label encoding
   * One Hot Encoding
   * TF-IDF
   
* 10 Fold cross validation applied in both models.

* Random Forest performs better than XGBoost.

* Combining the models gives even better results.
   
 
   
* Two models were used with cross validation. 

* Their predictions were averaged and RMSE of 20.4 was achieved.
